## Work ##

- Investigating enterprise-level WordPress. If anyone knows anything about customizable 
  portals with WordPress (like the My Yahoo and My Netscape of old), hit me up.
- Legacy software.

## Not Work ##

- Figuring out if me streaming on twitch can actually be a thing
- Working on [Chef Justine's story][chef], taking what I learned via
  the [#WIPjoy tag on Twitter][wipjoy] and hammering it into prose.
- Helping with [SC Codes][sccodes], thanks to [Alan][alan].
- Redesigning [oddEvan.com][oe] because why not. It's turning into an exercise in branding.
